    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>The project aims to address critical outstanding challenges in answer set programming, a leading
    knowledge representation/declarative constraint programming paradigm. Answer set programming has its
    roots in the need to support fast design of robust and reliable software solutions for complex
    knowledge-intensive applications. It reduces the programming task to modeling an application domain
    as a theory in a language  of logic, and leaves all computational concerns to automated reasoning.
    Answer set programming has been successfully used in scientific and industrial applications.</p>

    <p>The main goal of the project is to develop automated, integrated methods and algorithms to
    synergistically optimize answer set programs, select appropriate solvers, and optimally configure
    their parameters, each task mindful of and informed by the two  others. The underlying objectives are
    to support a systematic and principled process for building fast, scalable answer set programming
    solutions, and to make the declarative answer set programming technology the method of choice in a
    broad range of complex knowledge-intensive practical applications.</p> 

    <p>The project is sponsored under NSF grant 1707371. The project is a joint effort between the University 
    of Nebraska at Omaha and the University of Kentucky. The main component of the project is located at UNO
    (<a
    href=https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/natural-language-processing-and-knowledge-representation-lab/research-projects/optimization.php>follow this link)</a> with the UK component 
    being a subcontract to UNO; the present page archives work performed at UK.</p>

  <h3>Encoding Selection</h3>
  <p>
    We study machine learning approaches to encoding selection. Our focus so far has been on specific
    problems, including the Hamiltonian cycle problem, the wire routing problem and the snake puzzle.
    We obtained most promising results for the Hamiltonian cycle problem. We are seeking ways to
    generalize the approach we develped for the HC problem to other domains. We also seek to improve
    performance of solving by selecting some small number of encodings predicted to perform well for 
    an instance and running them according to a time schedule computed for the instance.

    <h3>Encoding selection platform</h3>
    <p>The encoding selection platform is an automated tool to generate, evaluate, and select encodings.
	Based on the instance set and enocodings provided by users, the system will rewrite and generate new encodings,
	evaluate the performance of all encodings to generate encoding candidates, 
	and finally build machine learning models to predict the best encoding or encoding schedule on a per-instance basis.

    <h3>Aggregator project </h3>
    <p> We study the problem of automating encoding rewriting by introducing, 
    removing and rewriting aggregates. Our current focus is on the count 
    aggregate. The goal is to show that aggregate intruduction and
    rewriting can be automated and can generate many alternative
    encodings of complementary strengths.  </p>

    <h3>Optimizing the use of ASP - beyond the single call case</h3>
    <p>In many cases, problems are solved not by a single answer-set
    program and a single call to an ASP grounder/solver, but by several
    calls to a grounder/solver made on carefully designed answer-set
    programs. Computing maximin share allocations, a problem of
    importance in social choice (preference aggregation and fair
    division), of that type. We proposed alternative ASP based solutions
    to these problems and are interested in finding rewriting of
    answer-set programs involved that might improve the overall
    effectiveness of the software.
    key tasks of the We study the use and effectiveness of ASP encoding rewriting when ASP is used to solve hard problems 
    requiring multiple calls to a solver. Our current focus is on the problem of fair division of indivisible 
    goods. 
    <h4>Encodings</h4>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="wrkidata/FairDivisionEncodings.zip">MaxiMin
	Share Encodings and Software</a>: Here we provide encodings and tools for generating and solving instances of the Maximin Share fairness problem, and different search algorithms for comparison.</li>
	</ul>
    <h4>Comments</h4>
    	<p>Fair division of indivisible goods on a graph is a computationallly 
	hard problem. In the general case, no efficient algorithms are 
	known for evaluating or allocating goods to satisfy the Maximin Share 
	(MMS) fairness criterion or, in other words, to allocate to each
	agent goods worth at least the maximin share value for the
	agent. The maximin share is defined as the best value the agent
	can get when the agent propose the allocation to others, let all
	other agents pick bundles in the allocation first and takes the
	last remaining bundle.
	</p>
	<p>In lieu of efficient algorithms we encode the evaluation, or calculation of the guarantees, and allocation, or final division of the resources, in the Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm of logic programming.
	Using an efficient ASP solver like Potassco Clingo we can solve instances of a significant size using a simple declarative encoding. The evaluation of guarantees is an iterative process, where the guarantee is increased
	until we reach the maximum guarantee the agent can expect to receive. We present several encodings which take advantage of two of Clingo's capabilities: optimization, and multi-shot solving. Clingo's optimization statements
	are executed by finding a valid solution with a particular value. Clingo then constrains subsequent solutions to be greater than or less than this value for maximization and minimization respectively. This is performed using 
	Clingo's powerful multi-shot solving capabilities, but there is potential for domain specific improvement. We are experimenting with replacing this general optimization statement with different search algorithms.
